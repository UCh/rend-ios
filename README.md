Rend - A lightweight OpenGL ES 2.0 framework for iOS
====================

Author: Anton Holmquist | http://antonholmquist.com

Rend is an OpenGL ES 2.0 Objective-C framework focusing on pure rendering. It's heavily inspired by the brilliant Cocos2D/Cocos3D frameworks. 

Note: This project has been my way of learning OpenGL ES 2.0, and it is an evolving framework. Don't expect future updates to be fully backwards compatible.
