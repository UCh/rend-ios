Rend - A lightweight OpenGL ES 2.0 framework for iOS
====================
Author: Anton Holmquist | http://antonholmquist.com

Rend is a very lightweight OpenGL ES 2.0 framework designed for pure rendering. 

Why another framework?
--------------------
Rend is similar in some senses to Cocos2d/3d, but it's lighter and very flexible which may suit some kind of projects better. If you're writing a game you should probably look at Cocos or Unity, but if you want to create a rendering or interface component to be integrated into your UIKit-based project, this framework may be well suited!

Background
--------------------
*When looking for a framework I looked at three existing options, Cocos2D, Cocos3D and Unity. None of those seemed perfect for my needs. Cocos2D obviously doesn’t have very good 3D support, Cocos3D didn’t have shader support, and Unity seemed to bloated and hard to integrate with UIKit."* The full story can be found in [this blog post](http://antonholmquist.com/blog/introducing-rend-a-lightweight-objective-c-opengl-es-2-0-framework-ios/).
