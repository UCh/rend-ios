Rend - A lightweight OpenGL ES 2.0 framework for iOS
====================
Author: Anton Holmquist | http://antonholmquist.com

Rend is a very lightweight OpenGL ES 2.0 framework designed for pure rendering. 

Why another framework?
--------------------
Rend is similar in some senses to Cocos2d/3d, but it's lighter and very flexible which may suit some kind of projects better. If you're writing a game you should probably look at Cocos or Unity, but if you want to create a rendering or interface component to be integrated into your UIKit-based project, this framework may be well suited!

Some background to this project can be found at http://antonholmquist.com/blog/introducing-rend-a-lightweight-objective-c-opengl-es-2-0-framework-ios/ 

Note: This is an evolving framework. Don't expect future updates to be fully backwards compatible. The project will probably stablize somewhat after the upcoming v1.0.0 release.
