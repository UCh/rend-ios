Rend - A lightweight OpenGL ES 2.0 framework for iOS
====================

Author: Anton Holmquist | http://antonholmquist.com

Rend is an OpenGL ES 2.0 Objective-C framework focusing on pure rendering. It's heavily inspired by the brilliant Cocos2D/Cocos3D frameworks. Some background to this project can be found at http://antonholmquist.com/blog/introducing-rend-a-lightweight-objective-c-opengl-es-2-0-framework-ios/ 

Note: This is an evolving framework. Don't expect future updates to be fully backwards compatible. The project will probably stablize somewhat after the upcoming v1.0.0 release.
