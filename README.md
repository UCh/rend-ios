Rend - A lightweight OpenGL ES 2.0 framework for iOS
====================

Rend is an OpenGL ES 2.0 Objective-C framework focusing on pure rendering. It's heavily inspired by the brilliant Cocos2D/Cocos3D frameworks.

This project has been my way of learning OpenGL ES 2.0. My focus has been to create a lightweight, straight-forward and flexible framework.

Note: This is an evolving framework. Don't expect future updates to be fully backwards compatible.
